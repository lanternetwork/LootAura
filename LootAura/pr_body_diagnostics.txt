## Goal

Add diagnostic runtime reporting from the web page to the Expo native HUD to verify whether the "in-app" contract (window.__LOOTAURA_IN_APP) is actually present on Android.

## Changes

### Web Side (Injected JavaScript)
- Extended ROUTE_STATE message to include:
  - inAppFlag: boolean indicating if window.__LOOTAURA_IN_APP === true
  - hasRNBridge: boolean indicating if window.ReactNativeWebView exists

### Native Side (Expo)
- Updated routeState type to include inAppFlag and hasRNBridge fields
- Updated handleMessage to parse and store diagnostic fields
- Updated diagnostic HUD to display:
  - inAppFlag=T/F/? (T=true, F=false, ?=not yet received)
  - hasRNBridge=T/F/? (T=true, F=false, ?=not yet received)

## Impact

- Diagnostics only: No changes to routing, loading, footer visibility, or URL handling
- Version: Incremented to 59
- Purpose: Helps debug why the web footer is still visible on Android by proving whether the injection flag is actually being set

## Testing

On Android device, view a sale detail page and check the HUD for:
- inAppFlag=T if the flag was set successfully
- hasRNBridge=T if the React Native WebView bridge is present

This will conclusively answer whether the injection is working on Android.
