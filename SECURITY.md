## Compliance & Standards

### OWASP Top 10 Compliance
- **A01: Broken Access Control**: RLS policies enforce owner-based access
- **A02: Cryptographic Failures**: HTTPS enforced, secure session management
- **A03: Injection**: Parameterized queries, input validation with Zod
- **A04: Insecure Design**: Threat modeling, secure architecture patterns
- **A05: Security Misconfiguration**: Security headers, CSP policies
- **A06: Vulnerable Components**: Dependency scanning, automated updates
- **A07: Authentication Failures**: Supabase Auth, secure session handling
- **A08: Software Integrity**: CI/CD security gates, signed commits
- **A09: Logging Failures**: Structured logging, security event monitoring
- **A10: Server-Side Request Forgery**: URL validation, allowlist approach

### Dependency Scanning
- **Automated Scanning**: CI security audit job runs on every PR
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: GitHub Dependabot for security updates
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking and approval

### Secrets Management
- **Centralized Vault**: Environment variables managed via Vercel
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data in environment variables
- **Rotation Policy**: Regular rotation of API keys and tokens
- **Access Control**: Least privilege access to production secrets

### RLS Posture
- **Public Read**: Sales data readable by anonymous users for browsing
- **Owner Write**: Only sale owners can modify their own sales
- **Profile Access**: Users can only access their own profiles
- **Filter Security**: Filters are not security controls - they are user preferences

### Log Policy
- **No PII**: No personally identifiable information in logs
- **Debug Gating**: All debug logs behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG` flag
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging format for consistency
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues

- **Medium Priority**: Response within 48 hours

### 7-Day Resolution SLA
- **Critical Issues**: Resolution within 24 hours
- **High Priority**: Resolution within 3 days
- **Medium Priority**: Resolution within 7 days

### Incident Communication
1. **Immediate**: Acknowledge and assess impact
2. **Hourly**: Status updates during active response
3. **Daily**: Progress reports until resolution
4. **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis and prevention

## Security Best Practices

- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date
- **Environment Security**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow OWASP Top 10 and secure coding practices
- **Monitoring**: Report suspicious activity immediately
- **Training**: Regular security awareness training for team members
