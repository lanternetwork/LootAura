# LootAura Changelog

**Last updated: 2025-10-19 — Release Hardening & Documentation**

## [Unreleased] Release Hardening & Documentation

### Added
- **URL State Management**: Robust compression/decompression with legacy URL handling
- **Console Guardrail**: Fail-on-error/warn system for test hygiene
- RLS Policy Verification: Comprehensive privilege escalation testing
- **Memory Stability**: Optimized test worker settings and heap management
- **Release Documentation**: Comprehensive runbooks, monitoring, and rollback procedures

### Changed
- **URL State Compression**: Enhanced with `lz-string` for better compression ratios
- **Console Discipline**: Stricter allowlist with test-specific annotations
- **Test Memory**: Single-fork mode with constrained workers to prevent OOMs
- **Environment Parity**: Complete env var matrix across dev/stage/prod

### Fixed
- **URL State Round-trip**: Proper handling of compressed vs JSON formats
- **React Prop Warnings**: Eliminated unknown props on DOM elements
- **Memory Leaks**: Prevented heap exhaustion during test runs
- **Console Noise**: Reduced unexpected console output in tests

### Security
- **RLS Hardening**: Deny-by-default policies with minimal public exposure
- **Secret Protection**: Verified service role keys are server-only
- **PII Scrubbing**: Confirmed no sensitive data in client logs

### Performance
- **Bundle Monitoring**: CI job for size regression detection
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced test worker count and heap usage
- **Cache Efficiency**: Improved offline caching and prefetch strategies

### Testing
- **Console Guardrail**: Automated detection of unexpected console output
- **RLS Testing**: Comprehensive privilege escalation test coverage
- **Memory Stability**: OOM prevention in CI test runs
- **E2E Synthetics**: Headless API-first smoke tests

### Upgrade Notes
- **URL State**: Legacy URLs are automatically handled; no breaking changes
- **Console Output**: Tests now fail on unexpected console.error/warn
- **Memory Usage**: Test runs use less memory but may take slightly longer
- **Environment**: New monitoring requires additional CI job configuration

## [2025-10-17] Stable Debounce Manager + CI All Green

### Added
- `docs/architecture/fetching.md`: Architecture doc covering debounce modes (`leading`, `trailing`, `leading-trailing`), abort/cancel behavior, and test invariants.

### Changed
- Debounce manager tests aligned to `trailing` mode for deterministic collapse of rapid requests.
- Refined test expectations to match mode semantics and fixed deferred-resolution in tests.
- Deflaked cluster performance consistency test using median-of-middle and a tolerance suited for CI variance.

### Fixed
- Persistent timeouts and mismatched expectations in debounce/cancel tests.
- Incorrect deferred promise resolutions in trailing mode unit tests.

### Testing
- Counters (`started`, `aborted`, `resolved`) asserted across scenarios: collapse, cancel/replace, abort signal propagation, and dispose.
