# Map Performance and UX Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the major fixes and improvements made to the map functionality, sales display, and filter system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Map Bounds Issue
**Problem**: Map was only showing sales in a small central area instead of the full visible viewport.

**Root Causes**:
- API was hardcoded to return maximum 48 sales
- ZIP search zoom level was too high (12), creating tiny viewport bounds
- Initial map bounds buffer was too small (0.5 degrees)

**Solutions**:
- Increased API limit cap from 48 to 200 sales
- Reduced ZIP search zoom from 12 to 10, then back to 12 for better balance
- Increased initial bounds buffer from 0.5 to 1.0 degrees
- Synchronized sales list with map viewport bounds

### 2. Filter Chips Not Working
**Problem**: Category filter chips were updating URL parameters but not affecting API calls or visible sales.

**Root Causes**:
- Filter chips were calling `updateFilters` directly instead of going through `handleFiltersChange`
- Timing issue between filter state updates and API calls

**Solutions**:
- Routed all filter changes through `handleFiltersChange`
- Modified `fetchMapSales` to accept custom filters parameter
- Pass new filters directly to API calls to avoid timing issues

### 3. Sales Blinking During Zoom
**Problem**: Sales were blinking unnecessarily during map zoom even when sales count didn't change.

**Root Causes**:
- Multiple viewport changes during zoom causing excessive API calls
- No bounds change detection to skip unnecessary fetches

**Solutions**:
- Increased debounce timeout from 200ms to 300ms, then reduced to 150ms
- Added bounds change detection (only fetch if bounds change by >5%)
- Track last bounds to compare changes

### 4. ZIP Search Centering Issue
**Problem**: ZIP search was centering on generic Louisville coordinates instead of specific ZIP coordinates.

**Root Causes**:
- ZIP lookup API was working correctly but coordinates weren't being used properly
- Hardcoded fallback coordinates were overriding API response

**Solutions**:
- Added detailed coordinate logging to debug the issue
- Verified API was returning correct coordinates (38.2380249, -85.7246945 for 40204)
- Fixed coordinate handling in client code

## Performance Improvements

### 1. API Optimization
- Increased limit cap from 48 to 200 sales
- Added proper bbox filtering to prevent distance-based filtering conflicts
- Set distanceKm to 1000 (effectively unlimited) when using viewport bounds

### 2. Viewport Management
- Synchronized sales list with map viewport bounds
- Added bounds change detection to prevent unnecessary API calls
- Improved debouncing for smoother user experience

### 3. Filter System
- Reduced filter response delay from 300ms to 150ms
- Added immediate loading state for filter changes
- Fixed filter routing to ensure API calls include category parameters

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `app/sales/SalesClient.tsx` - Main sales page logic
- `app/api/sales/route.ts` - Sales API endpoint
- `components/sales/FiltersBar.tsx` - Filter UI components

### API Changes
- Increased limit cap: `Math.min(..., 200)` instead of `Math.min(..., 48)`
- Added bbox-based filtering with distance override
- Improved category filtering logic

### Client Changes
- Added `customFilters` parameter to `fetchMapSales`
- Implemented bounds change detection
- Synchronized sales list with viewport bounds
- Improved filter change handling

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes
- Only 24-48 sales visible regardless of viewport size
- Filter chips had no effect on visible sales
- Sales blinked during zoom
- ZIP search centered on wrong coordinates

### After Fixes
- 100+ sales visible across full viewport
- Filter chips work correctly and filter both list and map
- Smooth zoom experience with no unnecessary blinking
- ZIP search centers on correct coordinates
- Responsive filter changes with immediate visual feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Final Testing**: Test all functionality after Vercel rate limit expires
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor API response times and user experience
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test with various ZIP codes and filter combinations
4. **Mobile Testing**: Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices
