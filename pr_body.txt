## Summary

This PR adds a new admin tool for testing promotions without Stripe charges, improves promotion status aggregation, and fixes several bugs.

## Features

### Admin Test Promotion Tool
- New admin-only tool at `/admin/tools` for activating/deactivating test promotions
- Supports multiple schedule modes: 7 days before sale start, now + 7 days, custom dates
- Sale selection via dropdown (published, non-archived sales)
- Displays active promotion window and quick links
- Prominent warning: "Admin test tool. No Stripe charge."

### Promotion Status Improvements
- Fixed `/api/promotions/status` to deduplicate and aggregate multiple promotions per sale
- Returns single status per `sale_id` with "any active" logic
- Client-side defensive handling for unexpected duplicate entries
- Dashboard and sale detail pages show promoted status correctly

### UI Improvements
- Sale detail page: Replaces "Promote this sale" CTA with "Promoted" status card when active
- Dashboard: Compact promotion badge (small pill + subtle end date)
- Fixed React hydration errors and loading state flicker

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed draft continuation from dashboard (wait for user auth before resuming)
- Gated all console.log/warn/error statements behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG` flag
- Fixed `activate-test` endpoint to handle multiple existing promotions (bulk expire before creating new)
- Added comprehensive integration tests for multi-promotion handling

## Technical Details

- Admin endpoints require `ENABLE_ADMIN_TOOLS=true` (or debug mode)
- Test promotions use `amount_cents: 0` and `status: 'active'`
- Promotion status aggregation: `is_active = any active`, `ends_at = max(active.ends_at)`, `tier = latest active.tier`
- All timestamp assertions in tests are deterministic (presence + validity + ordering, not exact values)

## Testing

- Integration tests for `activate-test` endpoint (multi-promotion case + idempotent case)
- Hardened test assertions with timestamp validation
- Regression guard: verifies only one live promo remains after operation
