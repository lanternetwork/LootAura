## Current Focus

Complete sale-info-page-improvements → begin M4: Seller Dashboard (payments-agnostic).

## Next Up

- M5: Seller Analytics

## Risks/Notes

- Payment and promotion features remain out of scope until LLC setup.

## Owner Acceptance Checklist (M4 draft)

1. Authenticated user can access `/dashboard` and view own listings.
2. CRUD works with RLS (no cross-user edits).
3. Settings persist; map/list updates reflect live.
4. No console errors; purple/yellow color scheme consistent.
