-- This migration is now redundant since 043_add_categories_to_test_sales.sql
-- creates both sales and items with proper categories.
-- This file can be deleted or left as a placeholder.

-- Note: Categories are stored in the items table, not the sales table.
-- The 043 migration creates the correct structure with sales + items.
